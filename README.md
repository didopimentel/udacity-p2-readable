# Udacity Posting Forum App

This is a React web application that was made for a Udacity nanodegree course. It simulates a posting forum. You can write comments and vote up or down for them. It includes a NodeJs backend to perform all the operations.

## Usage

After cloning the repository and installing all node module dependencies simply run the React project with
```
npm run start
```
To run the Node backend, please, use the readme that is inside the [api-server](https://github.com/didopimentel/udacity-p2-readable/tree/master/api-server) folder.
